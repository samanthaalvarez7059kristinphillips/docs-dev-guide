title: Configure Service Connections for Ruby 
---

After you create a service instance and bind it to an application you must configure the application to connect to the service. 


## <a id='config-file'></a>Define Connection in Configuration File ##

For a Ruby database application, you configure the database connection information in the application's `database.yml` file. When you bind a service to an application, the service connection details are written to the applications's `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable. `VCAP_SERVICES` lists, in JSON format, the services bound to your application and the credentials required to connect to each. 

In Ruby, you can read the contents of `VCAP_SERVICES` with `ENV`. For example:

~~~ruby

my_services = JSON.parse(ENV['VCAP_SERVICES'])
~~~

You use the hash key for the service to obtain the the connection credentials from `VCAP_SERVICES`. You can determine the hash key for a service from the output of the `cf services` command, which lists available services. For example:

<pre class="terminal">
  cf services
  Getting services in production... OK

  name           service           provider      version   plan     bound apps
  myservice      elephantsql       elephantsql   n/a       turtle   myapp

</pre>

The hash key is formed from the service provider and version --- *provider-version*. For the service listed above, the provider is "elephantsql" and the version is "n/a", resulting in a hash key of "elephantsql-n/a". 

You can obtain the credentials for the example service with these Ruby statements:

~~~ruby
  db = JSON.parse(ENV['VCAP_SERVICES'])["elephantsql-n/a"]
  credentials = db.first["credentials"]
  host = credentials["host"]
  username = credentials["username"]
  password = credentials["password"]
  database = credentials["database"]
  port = credentials["port"]
~~~

To configure a Rails application, you would change your `database.yml` to use
erb syntax to set the connection values using the credentials obtained from `VCAP_SERVICES`. If you are using the ElephantSQL Postgres service, your `database.yml` file might look like:

~~~

<%
  mydb = JSON.parse(ENV['VCAP_SERVICES'])["elephantsql-n/a"]
  credentials = mydb.first["credentials"]
%>

production:
  adapter: pg
  encoding: utf8
  reconnect: false
  pool: 5
  host: <%= credentials["host"] %>
  username: <%= credentials["username"] %>
  password: <%= credentials["password"] %>
  database: <%= credentials["database"] %>
  port: <%= credentials["port"] %>

~~~

If you are instantiating your adapter client directly, rather than using the active record pattern or another object-relation mapping (ORM) technique, your code would like something like this:

~~~ruby

mysqldb = JSON.parse(ENV['VCAP_SERVICES'])["cleardb-n/a"]
credentials = {
  :host => credentials["host"],
  :username => credentials["username"],
  :password => credentials["password"],
  :database => credentials["name"],
  :port => credentials["port"]
}

client = Mysql2::Client.new credentials

~~~

Your code may vary from the example above, depending on the hash key for the service and the syntax for instantiating your database adapter client.


## <a id='migrate'></a>Seed or Migrate Database ##

Before you can use your database the first time, you must create and populate or migrate it. For more information, see [Migrate a Database on Cloud Foundry](/docs/using/deploying-apps/migrate-db.html).

## <a id='troubleshooting'></a>Troubleshooting ##

If you have trouble connecting to your service, run the `cf logs` command to view log messages and see the values of the environment variables available to your application. `cf logs` command results include the value of the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable, for example:

<pre class="terminal">
  $ cf logs myapp
  Reading logs/console.log... OK
  Starting console on port 64868...

  Reading logs/env.log... OK
  VCAP_SERVICES={
    "elephantsql-n/a":[{
      "name":"elephant-postgres",
      "label":"elephantsql-n/a",
      "plan":"turtle",
      "credentials":{"uri":"postgres://username:password@server.example.com:5432/uniqid"}}]
  }
  ...more environment variables and values will show here...

  Reading logs/staging_task.log... OK
  ...output from the staging process displayed here...

  Reading logs/console.log
  ...output from running the application displayed here...

If you encounter the error "a fatal error has occurred. Please see the Bundler troubleshooting documentation", update your version of bundler and run `bundle install` again.

<pre class="terminal">
  $ gem update bundler
  $ gem update --system
  $ bundle install
</pre>
