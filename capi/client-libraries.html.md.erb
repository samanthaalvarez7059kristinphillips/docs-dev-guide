<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

The CAPI API is the entry point for most operations within the Cloud Foundry
platform. It can be used to mananage Organizations, Spaces and Applications, as
well as user roles and permissions withing those. It is also used to manage all
the Services provided by the platform, including provisioning, creating and
binding them to applications.

While one can develop programs that consume the CAPI API by talking to it
directly using the API documentation, it is sometimes simpler to use an
existing client library.

Currently the following API Clients are *supported*:

* Java: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client
* Scripting (via the CF CLI): http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/curl.html

The following clients are *experimental* and a work in progress:

* Golang: https://godoc.org/github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/api/cloudcontroller

The following clients are unofficial and may supported by third-parties:

* Golang: https://github.com/guidowb/cf-go-client
* Golang: https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/go-cfclient
* Node.js: https://github.com/prosociallearnEU/cf-nodejs-client
