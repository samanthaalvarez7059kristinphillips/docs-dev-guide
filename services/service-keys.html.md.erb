This topic describes managing service instance credentials manually with service keys. You can use service keys to connect to a service instance from a local client, or from an app that is not deployed by Cloud Foundry. Create, list, retrieve, and delete service keys using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). 


<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Not all services support service keys. Some services support credentials through <a href="./application-binding.html">application binding</a> only.</p>

## <a id='create'></a> Create a Service Key ##

To generate credentials for a service instance, use the `cf create-service-key` command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service-key MY-SERVICE MY-KEY
Creating service key MY-KEY for service instance MY as me@example.com...
OK
</pre>

Use the `-c` flag to provide service-specific configuration parameters in a valid JSON object, either in-line or in a file. 

To provide the JSON object in-line, use the following format:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service-key MY-SERVICE MY-KEY -c '{"permissions":"read-only"}'
Creating service key MY-KEY for service instance MY-SERVICE as me@example.com...
OK
</pre>

To provide the JSON object as a file, give the absolute or relative path to your JSON file:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service-key MY-SERVICE MY-KEY -c PATH-TO-JSON-FILE
Creating service key MY-KEY for service instance MY-SERVICE as me@example.com...
OK
</pre>

## <a id='list'></a> List Service Keys for a Service Instance ##

To list service keys for a service instance, use the `cf service-keys` command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf service-keys MY-SERVICE
Getting service keys for service instance MY-SERVICE as me@example.com...

name
mykey1
mykey2

</pre>

## <a id='detail'></a>Get Credentials for a Service Key ##

To retrieve credentials for a service key, use the `cf service-key` command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf service-key MY-SERVICE MY-KEY
Getting key MY-KEY for service instance MY-SERVICE as me@example.com...

{
  uri: foo://user2:pass2@example.com/mydb,
  servicename: mydb
}
</pre>

Use the `--guid` flag to display the API GUID for the service key:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf service-key --guid MY-SERVICE MY-KEY
Getting key MY-KEY for service instance MY-SERVICE as me@example.com...

e3696fcb-7a8f-437f-8692-436558e45c7b

OK
</pre>

## <a id='delete'></a>Delete Service Key ##

To delete a service key, use the `cf delete-service-key` command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf delete-service-key MY-SERVICE MY-KEY

Are you sure you want to delete the service key MY-KEY ? y
Deleting service key MY-KEY for service instance MY-SERVICE as me@example.com...

OK
</pre>

Add option `-f` to force deletion without confirmation.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf delete-service-key -f MY-SERVICE MY-KEY

Deleting service key MY-KEY for service instance MY-SERVICE as me@example.com...

OK
</pre>
