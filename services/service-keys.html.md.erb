_This page assumes you are using cf CLI v6._

This topic describes managing service instance credentials manually with service keys. You can use service keys to connect to a service instance from a local client, or from an app that is not deployed by Cloud Foundry. Create, list, retrieve, and delete service keys using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). 


<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Not all services support service keys. Some services support credentials through <a href="/devguide/services/application-binding.html">application binding</a> only.</p>
