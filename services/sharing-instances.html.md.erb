## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

Sharing a service instance between spaces, allows applications in different spaces to share databases, 
messaging queues and many other types of services. This eliminates the need for 
development teams to use service keys and user-provided services in order to bind 
their applications to the same service instance that was provisioned through `cf create-service`. 
This provides improved security, auditing, and a more intuitive user experience.

For example, if two development teams have applications in their own spaces, 
and both of those applications want to send messages to each other using a messaging queue, 
the development team in space A could create a new instance of a messaging queue service, 
bind it to their application, and share that service instance into space B. 
A developer in space B could then bind their application to the same service instance, 
and the two applications could begin publishing and receiving messages from one another. 

* Service instances can be shared into multiple spaces, across orgs.

* Developers and administrators can share service instances between spaces
in which they have the SpaceDeveloper role. 

* Developers who have a service instance shared with them can only bind and unbind to that 
service instance. They cannot update, rename, or delete it.

## <a id="enabling"></a> Enabling Service Instance Sharing in Cloud Foundry

To enable service instance sharing, an administrator must enable the `service_instance_sharing` flag:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf enable-feature-flag service_instance_sharing
</pre>

## <a id="sharing"></a> Sharing a Service Instance

To share a service instance, run the command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf v3-share-service -s OTHER_SPACE [-o OTHER_ORG] SERVICE_INSTANCE
</pre>

* You cannot share a service instance into a space where a service 
instance with the same name already exists. 

* To share a service 
instance into a space, the space must have access to the service and service plan of the service 
instance that you are sharing (use `cf enable-service-access`). 

* If a service instance was created using a service or service plan that you no longer have access to, 
you will still be able to share that service instance.


## <a id="unsharing"></a> Unsharing a Service Instance

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Unsharing a service instance 
automatically deletes any bindings to applications in the spaces it was shared into. 
This could cause applications to fail. Before unsharing a service instance, 
run <code>cf service SERVICE_INSTANCE</code> to see 
how many bindings exist in the spaces the service instance is shared into.</p>

You cannot delete or rename a service instance until it is unshared from all spaces.

To unshare a service instance, run the following:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf v3-unshare-service -s OTHER_SPACE [-o OTHER_ORG] SERVICE_INSTANCE
</pre> 

## <a id="security"></a> Security Considerations

* [Service keys](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/service-keys.html) 
cannot be created from a space that a service instance has been shared into. 
This ensures that developers in the space where a service instance has been shared from 
have visibility into where, and how many times, the service instance is being used.

* Sharing service instances does not automatically update application security groups. 
The network policies defined in the ASGs may need to be updated in order to ensure that 
applications using shared service instances can access the underlying service.

* Access to a service must be enabled via `cf enable-service-access` in order for a 
service instance to be shared into a space.

* Not all services are enable for sharing instances functionality. 
Contact the service vendor directly if you are unable to share instances of their service. If you are a service author, 
see [Enabling Service Instance Sharing](../../services/enable-sharing.html).

## <a id="disabling"></a> Disabling Service Instance Sharing in Cloud Foundry

To disable service instance sharing, an administrator runs the following:

<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf disable-feature-flag service_instance_sharing
</pre>

This will only prevent new shares from being created. To remove existing shares, see [Deleting All Shares](#deleting).

## <a id="deleting"></a> Deleting All Shares

The script below finds all service instances that are shared, 
and for each space that the service instance is shared into, all service 
bindings to that service instance are deleted, and all sharing relationships are deleted. 

If a service binding is not successfully deleted, the script continues trying to unshare subsequent service instances. 
To use this script, you must meet all of these requirements:

* Logged in 
as an administrator. 
* Using a CF CLI version greater than v280 
* Have jq installed

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This script has been tested in macOS Sierra 10.12.4 and Ubuntu 14.04.5. 
Use the script at your own risk.</p>

```

#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -u
set -e

# refresh auth token
cf oauth-token >/dev/null

for instance_guid in $(cf curl /v3/service_instances | jq -r '.resources[].guid'); do
  for space_guid in $(cf curl /v2/service_instances/$instance_guid/shared_to | jq -r 
'.resources[].space_guid'); do
    echo "Unsharing service instance $instance_guid from space $space_guid"

    set +e
    cf curl -X DELETE "/v3/service_instances/$instance_guid/relationships/shared_spaces/$space_guid"
    set -e
  done
done
```
