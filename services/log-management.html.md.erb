<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to drain logs from Cloud Foundry to a third party log management service.

Cloud Foundry aggregates logs for all instances of your applications as well as for requests made to your applications through internal components of Cloud Foundry. For example, when the Cloud Foundry Router forwards a request to an application, the Router records that event in the log stream for that app. Run the following command to access the log stream for an app in the terminal:

<pre class='terminal'>$ cf logs YOUR-APP-NAME</pre>

If you want to persist more than the limited amount of logging information that Cloud Foundry can buffer, drain these logs to a log management service.

For more information about the systems responsible for log aggregation and streaming in Cloud Foundry, see [Application Logging in Cloud Foundry](../deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html).

## <a id='marketplace-services'></a>Using Services from the Cloud Foundry Marketplace

Your Cloud Foundry marketplace may offer one or more log management services. To use one of these services, create an instance of the service and bind it to your application with the following commands:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf create-service SERVICE PLAN SERVICE-INSTANCE
$ cf bind-service YOUR-APP YOUR-LOG-STORE
</pre>

For more information on service instance lifecycle management, see [Managing Service Instances](managing-services.html).

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Not all marketplace services support syslog drains. Some services implement an integration with Cloud Foundry that enables automated streaming of application syslogs. <%= vars.custom_services %></p>

## <a id='user-provided'></a>Using Services Not Available in your Marketplace

If a compatible log management service is not available in your Cloud Foundry marketplace, you can use [User-provided Service Instances](./user-provided.html#syslog) to stream application logs to a service of your choice.

Your service may require some preparation before application logs can be streamed to it from Cloud Foundry. For specific instructions for several popular services, see [Service-Specific Instructions for Streaming Application Logs](./log-management-thirdparty-svc.html). If you cannot find instructions for your service, follow the generic instructions below.

### Step 1: Configure the Log Management Service

Complete the following steps to set up a communication channel between the log management service and your Cloud Foundry deployment:

1. Obtain the <%=vars.external_ips%> that <%=vars.admin%> assigns to outbound traffic.

1. Provide these IP addresses to the log management service.
The specific steps to configure a third-party log management service depend on
the service.

1. Whitelist these IP addresses to ensure unrestricted log routing to your log management service.

1. Record the syslog URL provided by the third-party service. Third-party services
typically provide a syslog URL to use as an endpoint for incoming log data. You use this syslog URL in Step 2: Create a User-provided Service Instance.
<br><br>
    Cloud Foundry uses the syslog URL to route messages to the service.
    The syslog URL has a scheme of `syslog`, `syslog-tls`, or `https`, and can
    include a port number.
    For example:

    `syslog://logs.example.com:1234`

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: <%=vars.product_short%> does not support using <code>syslog-tls</code> with self-signed certificates. If you are running your own syslog server and want to use <code>syslog-tls</code>, you must have an SSL certificate signed by a well-known certificate authority.</p>

### Step 2: Create a User-provided Service Instance

Create a user-provided service instance using the [cf CLI](../../cf-cli/) `create-user-provided-service` command with the `-l` flag and the syslog URL that you obtained in Step 1: Configure the Log Management Service.
The `-l` flag configures the syslog drain.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-user-provided-service SERVICE-INSTANCE -l SYSLOG-URL
</pre>

Refer to [User-Provided Service Instances](./user-provided.html) for more information.

### Step 3: Bind the Service Instance

You have two options for binding the service instance to an application:

* Run `cf push` with a manifest. The services block in the manifest must specify the service instance that you want to bind.
* Run `cf bind-service`

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-service YOUR-APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE
</pre>

After a short delay, logs begin to flow automatically. Refer to [Managing Service Instances with the CLI](./managing-services.html) for more information.

### Step 4: Verify Logs are Draining

To verify that logs are draining correctly to a third-party log management service:

1. Take actions that produce log messages, such as making requests of your app.

1. Compare the logs displayed in the CLI against those displayed by the log management service.

For example, if your application serves web pages, you can send HTTP requests to the application.
In Cloud Foundry, these generate Router log messages, which you can view in the CLI.
Your third-party log management service should display corresponding messages.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For security reasons, Cloud Foundry applications do not respond to <code>ping</code>. You cannot use <code>ping</code> to generate log entries.</p>
