title: Deploying Applications

This guide has instructions for pushing an application to Cloud Foundry and
making the application work with any available cloud-based services it uses,
such as databases, email, or message servers.
The core of this guide is the [Deploy an Application](./deploy-apps/getting-started.html) process guide, which provides
end-to-end instructions for running applications on Cloud Foundry,
including tips for troubleshooting deployment and application health issues.
