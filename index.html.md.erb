title: Deploying Applications to Elastic Runtime
---

This guide has instructions for pushing an application to Cloud Foundry and making the application work with any available cloud-based services it uses, such as databases, email, or message servers. The core of this guide is the [Deploy an Application](./deploy-apps/getting-started.html) process guide, which provides end-to-end instructions for running applications on Cloud Foundry, including tips for troubleshooting deployment and application health issues.

Before you can use the instructions in this document, you will need an account on your Cloud Foundry instance.
