title: Deploying Applications to Elastic Runtime
---


This guide has instructions for pushing an application to Cloud Foundry and making the application work with any available cloud-based services it uses, such as database, email, or message servers.  

The core of this guide is a “Getting Started” guide, which provides end-to-end instructions for running applications on Cloud Foundry, including tips for troubleshooting deployment and application health issues. 

In addition, this guide covers:

* Application design considerations: facts about the Cloud Foundry environment that relate file system usage and HTTP ports and sessions.

* How to install and use the command-line interface that you will use to deploy and manage  applications Cloud Foundry

* Information about the logical structure of your Cloud Foundry workspace. A Cloud Foundry user is granted access to _organizations_, and within them, _spaces_.  Logically speaking, your applications run in a space, and the roles associated with your user account govern your access to particular spaces.

Before you can use the instructions in this document, you will need an account on your Cloud Foundry instance.
