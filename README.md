Developer Guide
====

This guide explains how to use the cf command line tool to:

*  Deploy your application to Cloud Foundry
*  Provision and bind services
*  Scale your application
*  Troubleshoot problems with your application

Note that this documentation uses syntax for cf version 5.4.0

## Other Documentation Repositiories

We are currently in a time of transition.
Previously the documentation was all contained in a single repository.
The documentation is now split across multiple repositories.
The other repositories for Cloud Foundry are:

(links coming soon)

*  Operators Guide: How to install and operate Cloud Foundry using BOSH
*  Extending Cloud Foundry: adding custom services and buildpacks to Cloud Foundry

## Contributing to the Documentation

We gratefully accept issues and pull requests to the documentation.

While we are transitioning from publishing documentation using only middleman to our new toolchain, it 
will be difficult for you to preview what your changes look like. 
We will make our new docs tools public as soon as we can.

## More Cloud Foundry Resources

There are currently three public discussion lists for Cloud Foundry:

* [Running / Setting up Cloud Foundry](https://groups.google.com/a/cloudfoundry.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/vcap-dev)
