<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes the lifecycle of an application container for <%= vars.product_full %> deployments running on the Diego architecture.

##<a id="deployment"></a> Deployment

The application deployment process involves uploading, staging, and starting the app in a container. Your app must successfully complete each of these phases within certain time limits. The default time limits for the phases are as follows:

* Upload: 15 minutes
* Stage: 15 minutes
* Start: 60 seconds

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Your administrator can change these defaults. Check with your administrator for the actual time limits set for app deployment.</p>

Developers can change the time limit for starting apps through an application manifest or on the command line. For more information, see [The timeout attribute](manifest.html#timeout) section of the Deploying with Application Manifests topic.

##<a id="crash-events"></a>Crash Events

If an app instance crashes, <%= vars.product_full %> automatically restarts it by rescheduling the instance on another container three times. After three failed restarts, <%= vars.product_full %> waits thirty seconds before attempting another restart. The wait time doubles each restart until the ninth restart, and remains at that duration until the 200th restart. After the 200th restart, <%= vars.product_full %> stops trying to restart the app instance.

##<a id="evacuation"></a> Evacuation

Certain operator actions require restarting VMs with containers hosting app instances. For example, an operator who updates stemcells or installs a new version of <%= vars.product_full %> must restart all the VMs in a deployment. <%= vars.product_full %> automatically relocates the instances on VMs that are shutting down through a process called evacuation. <%= vars.product_full %> recreates the app instances on another VM, waits until they are healthy, and then shuts down the old instances. During an evacuation, developers may see their app instances in a duplicated state for a brief period.

##<a id="shutdown"></a> Shutdown

When <%=vars.product_name%> requests a shutdown of your app instance, either in response to the command `cf scale APPNAME -i NUMBER-OF-INSTANCES` or because of a system event, <%= vars.product_full %> sends the app process in the container a SIGTERM. The process has ten seconds to shut down gracefully. If the process has not exited after ten seconds, <%= vars.product_full %> sends a SIGKILL.

Apps must finish their in-flight jobs within ten seconds of receiving the SIGTERM before <%= vars.product_full %> terminates the app with a SIGKILL. For instance, a web app must finish processing existing requests and stop accepting new requests.
