Cloud Foundry allows multiple apps, or versions of the same app, to be mapped to the same route. This enables Blue/Green deployment, which is the deployment strategy that Pivotal recommends. See [Using Blue-Green Deployment to Reduce Downtime and Risk](./blue-green.html).

However, a routing conflict due to accidentally mapping multiples apps to the same route can cause unexpected behavior and file-load errors. 

If you suspect a routing conflict, run `cf apps` in the Cloud Foundry command line interface to check the routes assigned to your apps.
