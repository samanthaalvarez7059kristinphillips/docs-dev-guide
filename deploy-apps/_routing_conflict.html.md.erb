Cloud Foundry allows multiple apps, or versions of the same app, to be mapped to the same route. This enables Blue-Green deployment, which is the deployment strategy that Pivotal recommends. See [Using Blue-Green Deployment to Reduce Downtime and Risk](./blue-green.html).

However, multiple apps should be mapped to the same route only during a Blue-Green deployment. In other situations this can cause file load errors and other buggy behavior, as incoming requests will be randomly routed to one or the other app on the shared route.

See [Routing Conflicts](./troubleshoot-app-health.html#routing-conflict) for more information on troubleshooting this problem.

If you suspect a routing conflict, run <pre class='terminal'>cf routes</pre> in the Cloud Foundry command line interface to check the routes in your installation.

If two apps share a route and this is not a deliberate part of a blue-green deploy, choose one app to re-assign to a different route. Run the following to unmap that app:

<pre class='terminal'>cf unmap-route YOUR-APP-NAME OLD-ROUTE</pre>

Then run the following to map the app to a new, unique route:

<pre class='terminal'>cf map-route YOUR-APP-NAME NEW-ROUTE</pre>

<% end %>
