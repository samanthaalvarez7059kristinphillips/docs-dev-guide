Cloud Foundry allows multiple apps, or versions of the same app, to be mapped to the same route. This enables Blue-Green deployment, the deployment strategy that Pivotal recommends. See [Using Blue-Green Deployment to Reduce Downtime and Risk](./blue-green.html).

Multiple apps should be mapped to the same route only during a Blue-Green 
deployment. In other situations, routing multiple apps to the same route can cause file load errors and other buggy behavior, as incoming requests are randomly routed to one of the apps on the shared route.

See [Routing Conflicts](./troubleshoot-app-health.html#routing-conflict) for more information about troubleshooting this problem.

If you suspect a routing conflict, run `cf routes` to check the routes in your installation.

If two apps share a route outside of a Blue-Green deploy strategy, choose one app to re-assign to a different route and follow the procedure below:

1. Run `cf unmap-route YOUR-APP-NAME OLD-ROUTE` to remove the existing route from that app.

1. Run `cf map-route YOUR-APP-NAME NEW-ROUTE` to map the app to a new, unique route.
