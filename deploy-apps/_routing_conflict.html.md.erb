Cloud Foundry allows multiple apps, or versions of the same app, to be mapped to the same route. This enables Blue-Green deployment, which is the deployment strategy that Pivotal recommends. See [Using Blue-Green Deployment to Reduce Downtime and Risk](./blue-green.html).

However, a routing conflict due to accidentally mapping multiples apps to the same route will cause unexpected behavior and file-load errors.

See [Routing Conflicts](./troubleshoot-app-health.html#routing-conflict) for more information on troubleshooting this problem.

If you suspect a routing conflict, run <pre class='terminal'>cf apps</pre> in the Cloud Foundry command line interface to check the routes assigned to your apps.

If two apps share a route and this is not a deliberate part of a blue-green deploy, choose one app to re-assign to a different route. Run the following to unmap that app:

<pre class='terminal'>cf unmap-route YOUR-APP-NAME OLD-ROUTE</pre>

Then run the following to map the app to a new, unique route:

<pre class='terminal'>cf map-route YOUR-APP-NAME NEW-ROUTE</pre>
