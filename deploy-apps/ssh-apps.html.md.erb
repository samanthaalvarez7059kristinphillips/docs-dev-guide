<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

<i>This page assumes you are using cf CLI v6.13.0 or later.</i>

The cf CLI lets you securely log into remote host VMs running <%=vars.product_full%> application instances. This topic describes the commands that enable SSH access to applications, and enable, disable, and check permissions for such access.

## <a id="enable-disable-ssh"></a>Enabling and Disabling SSH Access

A cloud operator can deploy <%=vars.product_full%> to either allow or prohibit Application SSH across the entire deployment.

Within a deployment that permits SSH access to applications, developers can enable or disable SSH access to individual applications. Space administrators can blanket allow or disallow SSH access to all apps running within a space.

### <a id="configure-ssh-access-apps"></a>Configuring SSH Access at the Application Level
`cf enable-ssh` enables SSH access to all instances of an app:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf enable-ssh MY-AWESOME-APP
</pre>

`cf disable-ssh` disables SSH access to all instances of an app:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf disable-ssh MY-AWESOME-APP
</pre>

### <a id="configure-ssh-access-spaces"></a>Configuring SSH Access at the Space Level

`cf allow-space-ssh` allows SSH access into all apps in a space:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf allow-space-ssh SPACE-NAME
</pre>

`cf disallow-space-ssh` disallows SSH access into all apps in a space:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf disallow-space-ssh SPACE-NAME
</pre>

## <a id="check-ssh-permissions"></a>Checking SSH Permissions

`cf ssh-enabled` checks whether an app is accessible with SSH:
<pre class="terminal">$ cf ssh-enabled MY-AWESOME-APP
ssh support is disabled for 'MY-AWESOME-APP'
</pre>

`cf space-ssh-allowed` checks whether all apps running within a space are accessible with SSH:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf space-ssh-allowed SPACE-NAME
ssh support is enabled in space 'SPACE-NAME'
</pre>

## <a id="ssh-command"></a>Logging Into an Application Container with cf SSH
If SSH access is allowed at the deployment, space, and application level, you can run `cf ssh APP-NAME` from the cf CLI to start an interactive SSH session with a VM hosting an application. By default, it accesses the container running first instance of the application, the instance with index 0.
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf ssh MY-AWESOME-APP
</pre>

### <a id="ssh-common-flags"></a>Common cf SSH Flags
You can tailor `cf ssh` commands with the following flags, most of which mimic flags for the Unix/Linux `ssh` command. See `cf ssh --help` for more details.

* The `-i` flag targets a specific instance of an application. To log into the VM container hosting the third instance (index=2) of MY-AWESOME-APP, run:
<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf ssh MY-AWESOME-APP -i 2
</pre>

* The `-L` flag enables local port forwarding, binding an output port on your machine to an input port on the application VM. Pass in a local port, and your application VM port and port number, all colon delimited. Optionally, you can also prepend your local network interface, or it defaults to `localhost`.
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf ssh MY-AWESOME-APP -L [LOCAL-NETWORK-INTERFACE:]LOCAL-PORT:REMOTE-HOST-NAME:REMOTE-HOST-PORT
</pre>

* The `-N` flag skips returning a command prompt on the remote machine. This sets up local port forwarding if you do not need to execute commands on the host VM.

* The `-t`, `-tt`, and `-T` flags let you run an SSH session in pseudo-tty mode rather than generate terminal line output.

## <a id="other-ssh-access"></a>Application SSH Access without cf CLI

In addition to `cf ssh`, you can use other SSH clients such as `ssh`, `scp`, or `sftp` to access your application, as long as you have SSH permissions.

To securely connect to an application instance, you log in with a specially-formed username that passes information to the SSH proxy running on the host VM. For the password, you use a one-time SSH authorization code generated by `cf ssh-code`.  Here is the full procedure:

1. Run `cf app MY-AWESOME-APP --guid` and record the GUID of your target app.
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf app MY-AWESOME-APP --guid
d0a2e11d-e6ca-4120-b32d-140c356906a5
</pre>

1. Query the `/v2/info` endpoint of your deployment's Cloud Controller. Record the domain name and port of the `app_ssh_endpoint` field. Also note the `app_ssh_host_key_fingerprint` field, which you will compare with the fingerprint returned by the SSH proxy on your target VM.
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf curl /v2/info
{
   ...
   "app\_ssh\_endpoint": "ssh.MY-DOMAIN.com:2222",
   "app\_ssh\_host\_key\_fingerprint": "a6:14:c0:ea:42:07:b2:f7:53:2c:0b:60:e0:00:21:6c",
   ...
}
</pre>

1. Run `cf ssh-code` to obtain a one-time authorization code that substitutes for an SSH password. Or you can run `cf ssh-code | pbcopy` to automatically copy the code to the clipboard.
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf ssh-code
E1x89n
</pre>
<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong>The SSH proxy on the target VM contacts the Cloud Controller via the `app_ssh_endpoint` to confirm permission to allow SSH access. The client ID used by the proxy
must be advertised in the `/v2/info` endpoint under `app_ssh_oauth_client`.  See the [UAA documentation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/blob/master/docs/UAA-APIs.rst#api-authorization-requests-code-get-oauth-authorize-non-standard-oauth-authorize) for how to allocate an authorization code.</p>

1. Run your `ssh` or other command to connect to the application instance. For the username, use a string of the form cf:APP-GUID/APP-INSTANCE-INDEX@SSH-ENDPOINT, where APP-GUID and SSH-ENDPOINT come from the previous steps. For the port number, pass in the SSH-PORT  also recorded above. APP-INSTANCE-INDEX is the index of the instance you want to access.
<br/><br/>With the above example, you `ssh` into the container hosting the first instance of your app by running:
<pre class="terminal">
$ ssh -p 2222 cf:d0a2e11d-e6ca-4120-b32d-140c356906a5/0@ssh.MY-DOMAIN.com
</pre>
<br/>Or you can use `scp` to transfer files by running:
<pre class="terminal">
$ scp -P 2222 -o User=cf:d0a2e11d-e6ca-4120-b32d-140c356906a5/0 ssh.MY-DOMAIN.com:REMOTE-FILE-TO-RETRIEVE LOCAL-FILE-DESTINATION
</pre>

1. When the SSH proxy reports its RSA fingerprint, confirm that it matches the `app_ssh_host_key_fingerprint` recorded above. When prompted for a password, paste in the authorization code that `cf ssh-code` returned.
<pre class="terminal">
$ ssh -p 2222 cf:d0a2e11d-e6ca-4120-b32d-140c356906a5/0@ssh.MY-DOMAIN.com
The authenticity of host '[ssh.MY-DOMAIN.com]:2222 ([52.12.144.5]:2222)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is a6:14:c0:ea:42:07:b2:f7:53:2c:0b:60:e0:00:21:6c.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '[ssh.MY-DOMAIN.com]:2222 [52.12.144.5]:2222' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
cf:d0a2e11d-e6ca-4120-b32d-140@ssh.ketchup.cf-app.com's password:
vcap@ce4l5164kws:~$
</pre>

1. That's it. You're in!

## <a id="proxy-to-container-auth"></a>Proxy to Container Authentication

A second layer of SSH security runs within each container. When the SSH proxy attempts to handshake with the SSH daemon inside the target
container, it uses the following fields associated with the `diego-ssh` key in the LRP routes. This inner layer works invisibly and requires no user action, but is described here to complete the SSH security picture.

### container_port (required)
`container_port` indicates which port inside the container the SSH daemon is
listening on. The proxy attempts to connect to host side mapping of this
port after authenticating the client.

### host_fingerprint (optional)
When present, `host_fingerprint` declares the expected fingerprint of the SSH
daemon's host public key. When the fingerprint of the actual target's host key
does not match the expected fingerprint, the connection is terminated. The
fingerprint should only contain the hex string generated by `ssh-keygen -l`.

### user (optional)
`user` declares the user ID to use during authentication with the container's
SSH daemon. While this is not a required part of the routing data, it is required
for password authentication and may be required for public key authentication.

### password (optional)
`password` declares the password to use during password authentication with
the container's ssh daemon.

### private_key (optional)
`private_key` declares the private key to use when authenticating with the
container's SSH daemon. If present, the key must be a PEM encoded RSA or DSA
public key.

#### Example Application Process
```json
{
  "process_guid": "ssh-process-guid",
  "domain": "ssh-experiments",
  "rootfs": "preloaded:cflinuxfs2",
  "instances": 1,
  "start_timeout": 30,
  "setup": {
    "download": {
      "artifact": "diego-sshd",
      "from": "http://file-server.service.cf.internal:8080/v1/static/diego-sshd/diego-sshd.tgz",
      "to": "/tmp",
      "cache_key": "diego-sshd"
    }
  },
  "action": {
    "run": {
      "path": "/tmp/diego-sshd",
      "args": [
          "-address=0.0.0.0:2222",
          "-authorizedKey=ssh-rsa ..."
      ],
      "env": [],
      "resource_limits": {}
    }
  },
  "ports": [ 2222 ],
  "routes": {
    "diego-ssh": {
      "container_port": 2222,
      "private_key": "PEM encoded PKCS#1 private key"
    }
  }
}
```

### Daemon discovery

To be accessible via the SSH proxy, containers must host an SSH daemon, expose
it via a mapped port, and advertise the port in a `diego-ssh` route. If a proxy cannot find the target process or a route, user authentication fails.

```
  "routes": {
    "diego-ssh": { "container_port": 2222 }
  }
```

The Diego system generates the appropriate process definitions for <%=vars.product_full%> applications which reflect the policies that are in effect.
