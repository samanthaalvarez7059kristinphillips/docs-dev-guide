title: Domains and Shared Domains
---
_This page assumes you are using cf CLI v6._

This page has information about domains and shared domains.
For more information, see [Creating Domains and Routes](./domains-routes.html).

A domain is an IP resource represented by a domain name like "<%= vars.app_domain %>".
A domain is not directly bound to an application, but acts as part of the route
to an application.

When you deploy an application, you supply a hostname.
This hostname is prepended to the domain to create the full URL, or route, to
the application.

Example: If I use the hostname "demo-time" for my application, and my domain is
"<%= vars.app_domain %>", the route to the application is the full
URL "demo-time.<%= vars.app_domain %>".

A Cloud Foundry instance defines a default shared domain.
Unless you specify a different domain, routes to your application are created
using this shared domain.

Cloud Foundry also supports custom domains.

## <a id='create-domains'></a>Create a Custom Domain ##

If you want to use a registered domain of your own, you can:

- Create and associate it with a single organization in your account.

- Create and associate it with _all_ organizations in your account. Note: This can only be done by an **account** administrator.

### Associate a Custom Domain with a Single Organization ###

Use the `create-domain` command to create the custom domain `<%= vars.app_domain %>` in the
"test" organization:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-domain test <%= vars.app_domain %>
</pre>

### Associate a Custom Domain with All Organizations in an Account ###

Use the `create-shared-domain` command to create a shared custom domain
available to all organizations in your account:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-shared-domain <%= vars.app_domain %>
</pre>

## <a id='view-domains'></a>View Domains ##

You can see available domains for the targeted organization using the `cf
domains` command.
In this example, there are two available domains: a system-wide default
`<%=vars.app_domain%>` domain and the custom `example.org` domain.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf domains
Getting domains in org console as a.user@<%=vars.app_domain%>... OK

name           status
<%=vars.app_domain%>    shared
example.org     owned
</pre>

## <a id='delete-domains'></a>Delete a Domain ##

### Delete a Custom Domain ###

Use the `cf delete-domain` command to delete a domain:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf delete-domain <%= vars.app_domain %>
</pre>

### Delete a Custom Shared Domain ###

Deleting a shared domain can only be done by an **account** administrator.

**Caution**: Deleting a shared domain will remove all associated routes, and
will make any application with this domain unreachable.

To delete a shared domain:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf delete-shared-domain <%= vars.app_domain %>
</pre>
