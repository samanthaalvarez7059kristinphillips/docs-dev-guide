This topic describes enabling the Instance Identity system for your Cloud Foundry (CF) deployment.  The Instance Identity system provides each application instance with a unique PEM-encoded [X.509](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280) certificate and [PKCS#1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447) RSA private key pair that encodes its identity in the CF deployment.

The environment variable `CF_INSTANCE_CERT` contains the absolute path to the certificate. The environment variable `CF_INSTANCE_KEY` contains the absolute path to the key file. The provided certificate has the following properties:

- The `Common Name` property is set to the instance GUID for the given app instance.
- The certificate contains an IP SAN set to the container IP address for the given app instance.
- The certificate contains a DNS SAN set to the instance GUID for the given app instance.
- The `Organizational Unit` property in the certificate's Subject Distinguished Name contains the values `organization:<org-guid>`, `space:<space-guid>`, and `app:<app-guid>`. The `<org-guid>`, `<space-guid>`, and `<app-guid>` are respectively set to the GUIDs for the organization, space, and application as assigned by Cloud Controller.

By default, the certificate is valid for 24 hours after the container is created. The CF platform operator may have decreased this duration to as little as 1 hour via the `diego.executor.instance_identity_validity_period_in_hours` BOSH property.

The Diego cell rep will supply a new certificate and private key pair to the application instance before the end of the validity period. The new pair of files replaces the existing pair at the same path locations, with each file replaced atomically. If the validity period is greater than 4 hours, the pair will be regenerated between 1 hour and 20 minutes before the end of the validity period. If the validity period is less than or equal to 4 hours, the pair will be regenerated between 1/4 and 1/12 of the way to the end of the period.
