This topic describes how to use the Instance Identity system provided by Cloud Foundry. The Instance Identity system provides each application with a PEM-encoded [X.509](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280) certificate and [PKCS#1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447) RSA private key.

The environment variable `CF_INSTANCE_CERT` contains the absolute path of the certificate. The environment variable `CF_INSTANCE_KEY` contains the private key files. The provided certificate has the following properties:

- The `Common Name` property is set to the instance GUID.
- The certificate contains an IP SAN set to the container IP address for the given app instance.
- For Cloud Foundry apps, the `Organizational Unit` in the certificateâ€™s Subject Distinguished Name contains the values `organization:org-guid`, `space:space-guid`, `app:app-guid`. In that order `org-guid`, `space-guid`, and `app-guid` respectively are set to the guids for the organization, space, and application as assigned by Cloud Controller.

By default, the certificate is valid for 24 hours after the container is created. To change the validity period, set the `diego.executor.instance_identity_validity_period_in_hours` BOSH property. The smallest allowed validity duration is 1 hour.

The Diego Cell rep will supply a new certificate-key pair to the container before the end of the validity period. The new pair of files replaces the existing pair at the same path location, with each file replaced atomically.
