title: Trusted System Certificates
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

The Cloud Foundry Administrator can deploy a set of trusted system certificates to be made available in Linux-based application instances running on the Diego backend. Such instances include buildpack-based apps using the cflinuxfs2 stack and Docker-image-based apps. If the administrator has configured these certificates, they will be available inside the instance containers as files with extension `.crt` in the read-only `/etc/cf-system-certificates` directory. For cflinuxfs2-based apps, these certificates will also be installed directly in the `/etc/ssl/certs` directory, and so will be available automatically to libraries such as `openssl` that respect that trust store.
