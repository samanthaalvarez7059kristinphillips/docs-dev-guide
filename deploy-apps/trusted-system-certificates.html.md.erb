title: Cloud Foundry Application Trusted System Certificates (Diego Specific)
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

The Cloud Foundry Administrator can deploy a set of trusted system certificates 
that will be made available in Linux application containers, both cflinuxfs2 as well 
as Docker containers.

The application developer can access the set of trusted system certifcates in the 
container in `/etc/cf-system-certificates`.  This will be a read-only directory 
containing individual certificate files i.e. `certificate.crt`
