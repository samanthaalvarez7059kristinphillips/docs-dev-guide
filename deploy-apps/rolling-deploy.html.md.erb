This topic describes how developers use beta Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) commands or the Cloud Controller API (CAPI) to push their apps using a rolling deployment.

For information about the traditional method for addressing app downtime while pushing app updates, see [Using Blue-Green Deployment to Reduce Downtime and Risk](./blue-green.html).

For more information about CAPI, see the [Cloud Controller API Reference](https://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/).


## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

The procedures in this topic require one of the following:

* **cf CLI v7**:
	* You must have the cf CLI v7. While in beta, cf CLI v7 is only tested against the latest CAPI release candidate.
* **cf CLI v6**:
	* You must have cf CLI v6.40 or later.
	* The rolling deployment feature must be enabled for your installation.
		* <%= vars.zdt_enable %>
* **CAPI v3**:
  * You must have the cf CLI installed.



## <a id="commands"></a> Commands

This section describes the commands for working with rolling app deployments.

### <a id="deploy"></a> Deploy an App

To deploy an app without incurring downtime:

* **cf CLI v7**:

	```
	cf7 push APP-NAME --strategy rolling
	```
	<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> cf CLI v7 exits when one instance of each process is healthy. It also includes a <code>--no-wait</code> flag on push for users who do not want to wait for the operation to complete. No wait exits as soon as one instance is healthy.</p>

* **cf CLI v6**:

	```
	cf v3-zdt-push APP-NAME
	```

* **CAPI v3**:

1. Log in to the cf CLI.

	```bash
	cf login
	```

1. Create an empty app with `POST /v3/apps`. Record the app guid from the output.

    <pre>
    cf curl /v3/apps \
      -X POST \
      -H "Content-type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "name": "<span class="placeholder">APP-NAME</span>",
        "relationships": {
          "space": {
            "data": {
              "guid": "<span class="placeholder">SPACE-GUID</span>"
            }
          }
        }
      }'
    </pre>
    Where:
    - `APP-NAME` is the name you want to give your app.
    - `SPACE-GUID` is the space identifier you want to associate with your app.

1. Create a package with `POST /v3/packages`. Record the package guid from the output.

    <pre>
    cf curl /v3/packages \
      -X POST \
      -H "Content-type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "type": "bits",
        "relationships": {
          "app": {
            "data": {
              "guid": "<span class="placeholder">APP-GUID</span>"
            }
          }
        }
      }'
    </pre>
    Where `APP-GUID` is the unique identifier for your app that you recorded in the previous step.

1. Upload the package bits with `POST /v3/packages/PACKAGE-GUID/upload`.

    <pre>
    cf curl /v3/packages/<span class="placeholder">PACKAGE-GUID</span>/upload \
    -X POST \
    -F bits=@"<span class="placeholder">YOUR-PACKAGED-APP</span>" \
    </pre>
    Where:
    - `PACKAGE-GUID` is the package guid you recorded in the previous step.
    - `YOUR-PACKAGED-APP` is your app packaged in a file such as `.zip`.


1. Create the build with `POST /v3/builds`. Record the droplet guid from the output.

    <pre>
    cf curl /v3/builds \
      -X POST \
      -H "Content-type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "package": {
           "guid": "<span class="placeholder">PACKAGE-GUID</span>"
        }
      }'
    </pre>
    Where `PACKAGE-GUID` is the package guid you recorded in the previous step.


1. Deploy your app with `POST /v3/deployments`. If you want to check the status of the deployment or take action on the deployment, record the deployment guid from the output.

    <pre>
    cf curl /v3/deployments \
    -X POST \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "droplet": {
        "guid": "<span class="placeholder">DROPLET-GUID</span>"
      },
      "strategy": "rolling",
      "relationships": {
        "app": {
          "data": {
            "guid": "<span class="placeholder">APP-GUID</span>"
          }
        }
      }
    }'
    </pre>
    Where `DROPLET-GUID` and `APP-GUID` are the guids you recorded in the previous steps.


<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Ensure that you understand the limitations of this feature before running the command. For more information, see <a href="#limitations">Limitations</a>.</p>

For more information about this command, see [How It Works](#how-it-works).

### <a id="cancel"></a> Cancel a Deployment

To stop the deployment of an app that you pushed:

* **cf7 CLI v7**:

	```
	cf7 cancel-deployment APP-NAME
	```
* **cf CLI v6**:

	```
	cf v3-cancel-zdt-push APP-NAME
	```

* **CAPI v3**:

    <pre>
    cf curl /v3/deployments/<span class="placeholder">DEPLOYMENT-GUID</span>/actions/cancel" \
    -X POST
    </pre>
    Where the `DEPLOYMENT-GUID` is the guid you recorded after following the CAPI procedure in [Deploy an App](#deploy).

This reverts the app to its state from before the deployment started by doing the following:

* Scaling up the original web process
* Removing any deployment artifacts
* Resetting the `current_droplet` on the app

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The cancel command is designed to revert the app to its original state as quickly as possible and does not guarantee zero downtime.</p>

### <a id="restart"></a> Restart an App

Restart your app without downtime using the command below. This is useful when applying configuration updates that require a restart, such as environment variables or service bindings.

* **cf CLI v7**:
	```
	cf7 restart APP-NAME --strategy rolling
	```

* **cf CLI v6**:

	```
	cf v3-zdt-restart APP-NAME
	```

* **CAPI v3**:

    <pre>
    cf curl /v3/deployments \
    -X POST \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "droplet": {
        "guid": "<span class="placeholder">DROPLET-GUID</span>"
      },
      "strategy": "rolling",
      "relationships": {
        "app": {
          "data": {
            "guid": "<span class="placeholder">APP-GUID</span>"
          }
        }
      }
    }'
    </pre>

## <a id="how-it-works"></a> How It Works

This section describes the rolling deployments and their limitations.

### <a id="deployment-process"></a>  Rolling Deployment Process

This section describes the process of pushing an app with a rolling deployment strategy.

1. The `cf7 push APP-NAME --strategy rolling` command does the following:
	1. Stages the updated app package
	1. Creates a droplet with the updated app package
	1. Creates a deployment with the new droplet and any new configuration.
		* This starts a new process with one instance that shares the route with the old process.
		* At this point, if you run `cf app` on your app, you see multiple `web` processes.
		* For more information about the deployment object, see the [Deployments](http://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/index.html#deployments) section of the CAPI v3 docs.

1. Once the command creates the deployment, the `cc_deployment_updater` BOSH job runs in the background, updating deployments as follows:
	1. Adds another instance of the new web process and removes an instance from the old web process.
		<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This only happens if all instances of the new web process are currently running.</p>
	1. Repeats the above step until the new web process reaches the desired number of instances.
	1. Removes the old web process. The new web process now fully replaces the old web process.
	1. Restarts all non-web processes of the app.
	1. Sets the deployment to `DEPLOYED`.

### <a id="limitations"></a> Limitations

The following table describes the limitations to consider when using the rolling deployments.

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Limitation</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>App Manifests</td>
		<td>The <code>v3-zdt-push</code> command does not support providing an app manifest with the <code>-f</code> flag. If you have a `manifest.yml` file in your app directory, it is ignored. The cf CLI v7 beta does not have this limitation. However, the cf CLI v7 beta does not support multi-app manifests.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>SSH to app instances</td>
		<td>Pushing updates to your app with a <code>v3-zdt</code> command causes the new web
			process and app GUID to mismatch. <code>cf ssh</code> does not handle this
			scenario. You must use the <code>cf v3-ssh</code> command instead.
			<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This limitation only applies to cf CLI v6.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Multiple app versions</td>
		<td>During a deployment, Cloud Foundry serves both the old and new version of your app at the same route. This could lead to user issues if you push backwards-incompatible API changes.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Database migrations</td>
		<td>Deployments do not handle database migrations. If you are migrating an app database and the old app is not compatible with the migration, you may still have downtime.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Non-web processes</td>
		<td>Rolling deployments only run web processes through the rolling update sequence described above. The commands restart worker and other non-web processes in bulk after updating all web processes.<br><br>
		The CAPI v3 API introduces the concept of processes as runnable units of an app. Each app has a web process by default. You can specify additional processes with a procfile, and in some cases buildpacks create additional processes. For more information about processes, see the <a href="http://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/index.html#processes">Processes</a> section of the CAPI v3 documentation.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Quotas</td>
		<td>Pushing updates to your app using a rolling deployment strategy creates an extra instance of your app. If there is not enough quota available, the deployment does not work. Administrators may need to increase quotas to account for rolling deployments.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Simultaneous apps when interrupting a push</td>
		<td>If you push app before your previous push command for the same app has completed, your first push gets interrupted. Until the last deployment completes, there may be many versions of the app running at once. Eventually, the app runs the code from your most recent push.</td>
	</tr>
</table>


## <a id="status"></a> View the Status of Rolling Deployments

You can use CAPI to view the status of rolling deployments.
The following properties provide information about the status of rolling deployments:

* `status.value`: Indicates if the deployment is `ACTIVE` or `FINALIZED`. 

* `status.reason`: Provides additional detail about the reason
  for the `ACTIVE` or `FINALIZED` state.

* `status.details`: Provides the timestamp for the most recent successful healthcheck.
  The value of the `status.details` property can be `nil` if there is no successful healthcheck for the deployment.
  For example, there may be no successful healthcheck if the deployment was cancelled. 

The following table describes the possible values for the `status.value` and `status.reason` properties:

<table class="nice">
  <th width="20%"><code>status.value</code></th>
  <th width="20%"><code>status.reason</code></th>
  <th width="60%">Description</th>
  <tr>
    <td><code>ACTIVE</code></td>
    <td><code>DEPLOYING</code></td>
    <td>The deployment is deploying.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>ACTIVE</code></td>
    <td><code>CANCELLING</code></td>
    <td>The deployment is cancelling.</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td><code>FINALIZED</code></td>
    <td><code>DEPLOYED</code></td>
    <td>The deployment was deployed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>FINALIZED</code></td>
    <td><code>CANCELED</code></td>
    <td>The deployment was cancelled.</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td><code>FINALIZED</code></td>
    <td><code>SUPERSEDED</code></td>
    <td>The deployment was stopped and did not finish deploying because there was another deployment created for the app.</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td><code>FINALIZED</code></td>
    <td><code>DEGENERATE</code></td>
    <td>The deployment was created incorrectly by the system.</td>
  </tr>   
</table>  

To view the status of a rolling deployment:

1. Log in to the cf CLI:
    
    ```
    cf login
    ```

1. Run:
  
    ```
    cf curl GET /v3/deployments/DEPLOYMENT-GUID
    ```
    Where `DEPLOYMENT-GUID` is the GUID of the rolling deployment.
