title: Rolling App Deployments (Beta)
owner: CAPI
---

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: This CLI feature is currently experimental, use at your own risk. Further development of this feature will occur on CLI V7 beta.</p>

This topic describes how developers use beta Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) commands to push their apps using a rolling deployment. 

For information about the traditional method for addressing app downtime while pushing app updates, see [Using Blue-Green Deployment to Reduce Downtime and Risk](./blue-green.html).   

## <a id="prerequisites"></a>  Prerequisites

The procedures in this topic require the following: 

* You must have cf CLI v6.40 or later. 
* The rolling deployment feature must be enabled for your installation.
	* <%= vars.zdt_enable %>

## <a id="commands"></a> Commands

This section describes the beta commands for working with rolling app deployments. 

### <a id="deploy"></a>  Deploy an App

To deploy an app without incurring downtime, run the following command:

```
cf v3-zdt-push APP-NAME
``` 

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: Ensure that you understand the <a href="#limitations">Limitations</a> of this feature before running the command.</p>

For more information about this command, see [How it Works](#how-it-works). 

### <a id="cancel"></a>  Cancel a Deployment

To stop the deployment of an app that you pushed, run the following command:

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>v3-cancel-zdt-push</code> command is designed to revert the app to its original state as quickly as possible, and does not guarantee zero downtime.</p>

```
cf v3-cancel-zdt-push APP-NAME
```

This reverts the app to its state from before the deployment started by doing the following:

* Scaling up the original web process
* Removing any deployment artifacts
* Resetting the `current_droplet` on the app

### <a id="restart"></a> Restart an App

Restart your app without downtime using the following command. 
This is useful when applying configuration updates that require a restart, such as environment variables or service bindings. 

```
cf v3-zdt-restart APP-NAME
```

## <a id="how-it-works"></a> How It Works

This section describes the beta `cf v3-zdt-push` command and its limitations. 

### <a id="deployment-process"></a>  cf v3-zdt-push Process

This section describes the process of pushing an app with `cf v3-zdt-push`. 

1. The `cf v3-zdt-push` command does the following:
	1. Stages the updated app package
	1. Creates a droplet with the updated app package
	1. Creates a deployment with the new droplet and any new configuration. 
		* This starts a new process with one instance that shares the route with the old process. 
		* At this point, if you run `cf app` on your app, you see a `web` process and a `web-deployment-DEPLOYMENT-UUID` process.
		* For more information about the deployment object, see the [Deployments](http://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/index.html#deployments) section of the CAPI v3 docs. 
1. Once the command creates the deployment, the `cc_deployment_updater` BOSH job runs in the background, updating deployments as follows:
	1. Adds another instance of the new web process and removes an instance from the old web process. 
		<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This only happens if all instances of the new web process are currently running.</p>
	1. Repeats the above step until the new web process reaches the desired number of instances. 
	1. Removes the old web process. The new web process now fully replaces the old web process.
	1. Restarts all non-web processes of the app. 
	1. Sets the deployment to `DEPLOYED`. 

### <a id="limitations"></a>  Limitations

The following table describes the limitations to consider when using the beta `v3-zdt-push` command. 

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Limitation</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Multiple app versions</td>
		<td>During a deployment, Cloud Foundry serves both the old and new version of your app at the same route. This could lead to user issues if you push backwards-incompatible API changes.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Database migrations</td>
		<td>Deployments do not handle database migrations. If you are migrating an app database and the old app is not compatible with the migration, you may still have downtime. 
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Non-web processes</td>
		<td>The <code>v3-zdt</code> commands only run web processes through the rolling update sequence described above. The commands restart worker and other non-web processes in bulk after updating all web processes.<br><br>
		The CAPI v3 API introduces the concept of processes as runnable units of an app. Each app has a web process by default. You can specify additional processes with a procfile, and in some cases buildpacks create additional processes. For more information about processes, see the <a href="http://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/index.html#processes">Processes</a> section of the CAPI v3 documentation. 
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Quotas</td>
		<td>Pushing updates to your app with a <code>v3-zdt</code> command creates an extra instance of your app. If there is not enough quota available, the deployment does not work. Administrators may need to increase quotas to account for rolling deployments.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Simultaneous apps when interrupting a push</td>
		<td>If you run <code>v3-zdt-push</code> for an app before your previous <code>v3-zdt-push</code> command for the same app has completed, your first push gets interrupted. Until the last deployment completes, there may be many versions of the app running at once. Eventually, the app runs the code from your most recent push.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>SSH to app instances</td>
		<td>Pushing updates to your app with a <code>v3-zdt</code> command causes the new web
			process and app GUID to mismatch. <code>cf ssh</code> does not handle this
			scenario. You must use the <code>cf v3-ssh</code> command instead.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
