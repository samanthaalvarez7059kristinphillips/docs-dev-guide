title: Identifying the API Endpoint for your Cloud Foundry Instance
---

The API endpoint, or target URL, for your Cloud Foundry instance is the URL of the Cloud Controller in your Cloud Foundry instance.

## <a id='console'></a>From the Developer Console ##

If you have access to the Developer Console for your Cloud Foundry instance,
click **Tools** in the left navigation panel.
The **Getting Started** section of the Tools page shows your API endpoint.

## <a id='cli'></a>From the Command Line ##

From a command line, use the `cf api` command to view your API endpoint.

Example:

<pre class='termnial'>
$ cf api
API endpoint: https://api.sample.com (API version: 2.2.0)
</pre>
