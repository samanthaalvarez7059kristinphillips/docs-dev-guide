<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

You use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface tool (cf CLI) `cf push` command to deploy apps. `cf push` deploys apps with a default number of instances, disk space limit, and memory limit. You can override the default values by invoking `cf push` with flags and values, or by specifying key-value pairs in a manifest file.

Manifests provide consistency and reproducibility, and can help you automate deploying apps.


## <a id='find-manifest'></a> How cf push Finds the Manifest

By default, the `cf push` command deploys an application using a `manifest.yml`
file in the current working directory.

For example: 
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push
Using manifest file /path-to-current-working-directory/manifest.yml
</pre>

If you have created your manifest in a different location, use `cf push -f PATH-TO-MANIFEST`. Replace `PATH-TO-MANIFEST` with the path to your manifest. You can include the name of your mainfest file in `PATH-TO-MANIFEST`.  

For example: 
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push -f ./different-directory-1/different-directory-2/alternate_manifest.yml
Using manifest file ./different-directory-1/different-directory-2/alternate_manifest.yml
</pre>

If you provide a path with no filename, the `cf push` command requires a file named `manifest.yml`.

For example:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push -f ./different-directory-1/different-directory-2/
Using manifest file ./different-directory-1/different-directory-2/manifest.yml
</pre>


## <a id='minimal-manifest'></a> Example Manifest

Although you can deploy apps without a manifest, manifests provide consistency and reproducibility. This can be useful when you want your apps to be portable between different clouds.

Manifests are written in YAML. The manifest below illustrates some YAML conventions, as follows:

* The manifest begins with three dashes.
* The `applications` block begins with a heading followed by a colon.
* The application `name` is preceded by a single dash and one space.
* Subsequent lines in the block are indented two spaces to align with `name`.

<pre>
---
applications:
- name: my-app
  memory: 512M
  instances: 2
</pre>

A minimal manifest requires only an application `name`.
To create a valid minimal manifest, remove the `memory` and `instances` properties from this example.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: There are certain forbidden characters for the application <code>name</code> value. For instance, <code>-</code> is a forbidden character.</p>


## <a id='name'></a> Always Provide an Application Name to cf push

`cf push` requires an application name, which you provide either in a manifest
or at the command line.

As described in [How cf push Finds the Manifest](#find-manifest) above, the
command `cf push` locates the `manifest.yml` in the current working
directory by default, or in the path provided by the `-f` option.

If you do not use a manifest, the minimal `cf push` command looks like this:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-app
</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you provide an application name at the command line, <code>cf push</code> uses that application name whether or not there is a different application name in the manifest. If the manifest describes multiple applications, you can push a single application by providing its name at the command line; the cf CLI does not push the others.
Use these behaviors for testing.</p>


## <a id='find-app'></a> How cf push Finds the Application

By default, `cf push` recursively pushes the contents of the current working directory. Alternatively, you can provide a path using either a manifest or a command line option.

- If the path is to a directory, `cf push` recursively pushes the contents of that directory instead of the current working directory.
- If the path is to a file, `cf push` pushes only that file.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you want to push more than a single file, but not the entire contents of a directory, consider using a <code>.cfignore</code> file to tell <code>cf push</code> what to exclude.</p>


## <a id='precedence'></a> Precedence Between Manifests, Command Line Options, and Most Recent Values ##

When you push an application for the first time, Cloud Foundry applies default values to any attributes that you do not set in a manifest or `cf push` command line options.

* For example, `cf push my-app` with no manifest might deploy one instance of the app with one gigabyte of memory.
In this case the default values for instances and memory are "1" and "1G", respectively.

Between one push and another, attribute values can change in other ways.

* For example, the `cf scale` command changes the number of instances.

The attribute values on the server at any one time represent the cumulative result of all settings applied up to that point: defaults, attributes in the manifest, `cf push` command line options, and commands like `cf scale`.
There is no special name for this resulting set of values on the server.
You can think of them as the most recent values.

`cf push` follows rules of precedence when setting attribute values:

* Manifests override most recent values, including defaults.
* Command line options override manifests.

In general, you can think of manifests as just another input to `cf push`, to be combined with command line options and most recent values.


## <a id='optional-attributes'></a> Optional Attributes

This section explains how to describe optional application attributes in manifests. Each of these attributes can also be specified by a command line option. Command line options override the manifest.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The route component attributes <code>domain</code>, <code>domains</code>, <code>host</code>, <code>hosts</code>, and <code>no-hostname</code> have been deprecated in favor of the <code>routes</code> attribute. For more information, see <a href=#deprecated>Deprecated App Manifest Features</a>.</p>

### <a id='buildpack'></a> buildpacks

If your application requires a custom buildpack, you can use the `buildpacks` attribute to specify it in a number of ways:

* By name: `MY-BUILDPACK`. 
* By GitHub URL: `https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git`. 
* By GitHub URL with a branch or tag: `https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git#v3.3.0` for the `v3.3.0` tag.

<pre>
---
  ...
  buildpacks: 
    - buildpack_URL
</pre>

If you are using multiple buildpacks, you can provide an additional `-b` flag or add an additional value to your manifest:

<pre>
---
  ...
  buildpacks: 
    - buildpack_URL
    - buildpack_URL
</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must specify multiple buildpacks in the correct order: the buildpack will use the app start command given by the final buildpack. See <a href=https://github.com/cloudfoundry/multi-buildpack#usageapp</a> for more information.</p>

Also see [Pushing an Application with Multiple Buildpacks](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/use-multiple-buildpacks.html) for more information. 


<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>cf buildpacks</code> command lists the buildpacks that you can refer to by name in a manifest or a command line option.</p>

The command line option that overrides this attribute is `-b`.

### <a id='start-commands'></a> command

Some languages and frameworks require that you provide a custom command to start an application. Refer to the [buildpack](../../buildpacks/index.html) documentation to determine if you need to provide a custom start command.

You can provide the custom start command in your application manifest or on the command line. See <a href="./start-restart-restage.html">Starting, Restarting, and Restaging Applications</a> for more information about how Cloud Foundry determines its default start command. 

To specify the custom start command in your application manifest, add it in the `command: START-COMMAND` format as the following example shows:

<pre>
---
  ...
  command: bundle exec rake VERBOSE=true
</pre>

The start command you specify becomes the default for your application. To return to using the original default start command set by your buildpack, you must explicitly set the attribute to `null` as follows: 


<pre>
---
  ...
  command: null
</pre>

On the command line, use the `-c` option to specify the custom start command as the following example shows:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-app -c "bundle exec rake VERBOSE=true"
</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>-c</code> option with a value of 'null' forces <code>cf push</code> to use the buildpack start command. See <a href="./start-restart-restage.html#revert">Forcing cf push to use the Buildpack Start Command</a> for more information.</p>

If you override the start command for a Buildpack application, Linux uses
<code>bash -c YOUR-COMMAND</code> to invoke your application.
If you override the start command for a Docker application, Linux uses <code>sh -c YOUR-COMMAND</code> to invoke your application.
Because of this, if you override a start command, you should prefix <code>exec</code> to the final command in your custom composite start command.

An app needs to catch [termination signals](./prepare-to-deploy.html#moving-apps) and clean itself up appropriately. Because of the way that shells manage process trees, the use of custom composite shell commands, particularly those that create child processes using `&`, `&&`, `||`, etc., can prevent your app from receiving signals that are sent to the top level bash process.

To resolve this issue, you can use `exec` to replace the bash process with your own process. For example:

  * `bin/rake cf:on_first_instance db:migrate && bin/rails server -p $PORT -e $RAILS_ENV` The process tree is bash -> ruby, so on graceful shutdown only the bash process receives the TERM signal, not the ruby process.

  * `bin/rake cf:on_first_instance db:migrate && exec bin/rails server -p $PORT -e $RAILS_ENV` Because of the `exec` prefix included on the final command, the ruby process invoked by rails takes over the bash process managing the execution of the composite command. The process tree is only ruby, so the ruby web server receives the TERM signal and can shutdown gracefully for 10 seconds.

In more complex situations, like making a custom buildpack, you may want to use bash `trap`, `wait`, and backgrounded processes to manage your process tree and shut down apps gracefully. In most situations, however, a well-placed `exec` should be sufficient.

### <a id='disk-quota'></a> disk_quota

Use the `disk_quota` attribute to allocate the disk space for your app instance. This attribute requires a unit of measurement: `M`, `MB`, `G`, or `GB`, in upper case or lower case.

<pre>
---
  ...
  disk_quota: 1024M
</pre>

The command line option that overrides this attribute is `-k`.

### <a id='docker'></a> docker

If your application is contained in a Docker image, then you may use the `docker` attribute to specify it and an optional Docker username.

This attribute is a combination of `push` options that include `--docker-image` and `--docker-username`.

<pre>
---
  ...
  docker:
    image: docker-image-repository/docker-image-name
    username: docker-user-name
</pre>

The command line option `--docker-image` or `-o` overrides `docker.image`.  The command line option `--docker-username` overrides `docker.username`.

The manifest attribute `docker.username` is optional.  If it is used, then the password must be provided in the environment variable `CF_DOCKER_PASSWORD`.  Additionally, if a Docker username is specified, then a Docker image must also be specified.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Using the <code>docker</code> attribute in conjunction with the <code>buildpacks</code> or <code>path</code> attributes will result in an error.</p>


### <a id='health-check-http-endpoint'></a> health-check-http-endpoint

Use the `health-check-http-endpoint` attribute to customize the endpoint for the `http` health check type. If you do not provide a `health-check-http-endpoint` attribute, 
it uses endpoint '/'.

<pre>
---
  ...
  health-check-type: http
  health-check-http-endpoint: /health
</pre>

### <a id='health-check-type'></a> health-check-type

Use the `health-check-type` attribute to set the `health_check_type` flag to either `port`, `process` or `http`. If you do not provide a `health-check-type` attribute, 
it defaults to `port`.

<pre>
---
  ...
  health-check-type: port
</pre>

The command line option that overrides this attribute is `-u`.

The value of `none` is deprecated in favor of `process`.

### <a id='memory'></a> memory

Use the `memory` attribute to specify the memory limit for all instances of an app. This attribute requires a unit of measurement: `M`, `MB`, `G`, or `GB`, in upper case or lower case. For example:

<pre>
---
  ...
  memory: 1024M
</pre>

The default memory limit is 1G. You might want to specify a smaller limit to conserve <%=vars.quota_resource%> if you know that your app instances do not require 1G of memory.

The command line option that overrides this attribute is `-m`.

### <a id='no-route'></a>no-route

By default, `cf push` assigns a route to every app. But, some apps process data while running in the background and should not be assigned routes.

You can use the `no-route` attribute with a value of `true` to prevent a route from being created for your app.

<pre>
---
  ...
  no-route: true
</pre>
The command line option that overrides this attribute is `--no-route`.

In the Diego architecture, `no-route` skips creating and binding a route for the app, but does not specify which type of health check to perform. If your app does not listen on a port because it is a worker or a scheduler app, then it does not satisfy the port-based health check and Cloud Foundry marks it as crashed. To prevent this, disable the port-based health check with `cf set-health-check APP_NAME process`.

To remove a route from an existing app, perform the following steps:

1. Remove the route using the `cf unmap-route` command.
1. Push the app again with the `no-route: true` attribute in the manifest or the `--no-route` command line option.

For more information, see [Describing Multiple Applications with One Manifest](#multi-apps) below.

### <a id='path'></a> path

You can use the `path` attribute to tell Cloud Foundry the directory location where it can find your application. 

The directory specified as the `path`, either as an attribute or as a parameter on the command line, becomes the location where the buildpack `Detect` script executes.

The command line option that overrides this attribute is `-p`.

<pre>
---
  ...
  path: /path/to/application/bits
</pre>

For more information, see the [How cf push Finds the Application](#find-app) topic.

### <a id='random-route'></a> random-route

If you push your app without specifying any route-related CLI options or app manifest flags, the cf CLI attempts to generate a route based on the app name, which can cause collisions. 

You can use the `random-route` attribute to generate a unique route and avoid name collisions.  
When you use `random-route`, the cf CLI generates an HTTP route with a random host (if `host` is not set) or a TCP route with an unused port number.

See the following example use cases:

* You deploy the same app to multiple spaces for testing purposes. In this situation, you can use `random-route` to randomize routes declared with the route attribute in the app manifest.
* You use an app manifest for a classroom training exercise in which multiple users deploy the same app to the same space.

The command line option that overrides this attribute is `--random-route`.

<pre>
---
  ...
  random-route: true
</pre>

### <a id='routes'></a> routes

Use the `routes` attribute to provide multiple HTTP and TCP routes. Each route for this app is created if it does not already exist.

This attribute is a combination of `push` options that include `--hostname`, `-d`, and `--route-path`.

<pre>
---
  ...
  routes:
  - route: example.com
  - route: www.example.com/foo
  - route: tcp-example.com:1234
</pre>

#### <a id='manifest-attibutes-2'></a> Manifest Attributes
The `routes` attribute cannot be used in conjunction with the following attributes: `host`, `hosts`, `domain`, `domains`, and `no-hostname`. An error will result.

#### <a id='push-flag-options'></a> Push Flag Options
This attribute has unique interactions with different command line options.
<table border="1" class="nice" >
<tr>
<th>Push Flag Option</th>
<th>Resulting Behaviour</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>--no-route</code></td>
<td>All declared routes are ignored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>-d</code></td>

<tr>
<td><code>--random-route</code></td>
<td>Sets or overrides the HOSTNAME in all HTTP routes.<br />
Sets or overrides the PORT in all TCP routes.<br />
The PORT and HOSTNAME will be randomly generated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
</table>

### <a id='stack'></a> stack

Use the `stack` attribute to specify which stack to deploy your application to.

To see a list of available stacks, run `cf stacks` from the cf CLI.

<pre>
---
  ...
  stack: cflinuxfs2
</pre>

The command line option that overrides this attribute is `-s`.

### <a id='timeout'></a> timeout

The `timeout` attribute defines the number of seconds that Cloud Foundry allocates for starting your application. It is related to the `health-check-type` attribute.

For example:

<pre>
---
  ...
  timeout: 80
</pre>

You can increase the timeout length for very large apps that require more time to start. The `timeout` attribute defaults to 60, but you can set it to any value up to the Cloud Controller's `cc.maximum_health_check_timeout` property.

`cc.maximum_health_check_timeout` defaults to 180, but your Cloud Foundry operator can set to any value.

The command line option that overrides the timeout attribute is `-t`.

<p class='warning'><strong>WARNING:</strong> Cloud Controller will report a validation error with the maximum limit if you to configure <code>timeout</code> with a value greater than it.</p>


## <a id='env-block'></a> Environment Variables

The `env` block consists of a heading, then one or more environment variable/value pairs.

For example:

<pre>
---
  ...
  env:
    RAILS_ENV: production
    RACK_ENV: production
</pre>

`cf push` deploys the application to a container on the server. The variables belong to the container environment.

While the application is running, you can modify environment variables.

* View all variables: `cf env my-app`
* Set an individual variable: `cf set-env my-app my-variable_name my-variable_value`
* Unset an individual variable: `cf unset-env my-app my-variable_name my-variable_value`

Environment variables interact with manifests in the following ways:

* When you deploy an application for the first time, Cloud Foundry reads the variables described in the environment block of the manifest and adds them to 
the environment of the container where the application is staged, and the environment of the container where the application is deployed.

* When you stop and then restart an application, its environment variables persist.


## <a id='services-block'></a> Services

Applications can bind to services such as databases, messaging, and key-value stores.

Applications are deployed into App Spaces. An application can only bind to services instances that exist in the target App Space before the application is deployed.

The `services` block consists of a heading, then one or more service instance names.

Whoever creates the service chooses the service instance names. These names can convey logical information, as in `backend_queue`, describe the nature of the service, as in `mysql_5.x`, or do neither, as in the example below.

<pre>
---
  ...
  services:
   - instance_ABC
   - instance_XYZ
</pre>

Binding to a service instance is a special case of setting an environment variable, namely `VCAP_SERVICES`. See the [Bind a Service](../services/application-binding.html#bind) section of the _Delivering Service Credentials to an Application_ topic.


## <a id='multi-apps'></a> Describing Multiple Applications with One Manifest

You can deploy multiple applications with one `cf push` command by describing the apps in a single manifest. 

Suppose you want to deploy two applications called respectively spark and flame, and you want Cloud Foundry to create and start spark before flame. You accomplish this by listing spark first in the manifest.

In this situation there are two sets of bits that you want to push. Let’s say that they are `spark.rb` in the spark directory and `flame.rb` in the flame directory. One level up, the `fireplace` directory contains the spark and the flame directories along with the `manifest.yml` file. Your plan is to run the cf CLI from the `fireplace` directory, where you know it can find the manifest.

Now that you have changed the directory structure and manifest location, `cf push` can no longer find your applications by its default behavior of looking in the current working directory. How can you ensure that `cf push` finds the bits you want to push?

The answer is to add a path line to each application description to lead `cf push` to the correct bits. Assume that `cf push` is run from the `fireplace` directory.

For `spark`:

<pre>
---
  ...
  path: ./spark/
</pre>

For `flame`:

<pre>
---
  ...
  path: ./flame/
</pre>

The manifest now consists of two applications blocks.

<pre>
---
# this manifest deploys two applications
# apps are in flame and spark directories
# flame and spark are in fireplace
# cf push should be run from fireplace
applications:
- name: spark
  memory: 1G
  instances: 2
  host: flint-99
  domain: <%=vars.app_domain%>
  path: ./spark/
  services:
  - mysql-flint-99
- name: flame
  memory: 1G
  instances: 2
  host: burnin-77
  domain: <%=vars.app_domain%>
  path: ./flame/
  services:
  - redis-burnin-77
</pre>

Follow these general rules when using a multiple-application manifest:

* Name and completely describe your applications in the manifest.

* Use a `no-route` line in the description of any application that provides background services to another application.

* Do not provide an application name with `cf push`.

* Do not use any command line options with `cf push`.

There are only two narrow exceptions:

* If your manifest is not named `manifest.yml` or not in the current working directory, use the `-f` command line option.

* If you want to push a single application rather than all of the applications described in the manifest, provide the desired application name by running `cf push my-app`.


## <a id='minimize-duplication'></a> Minimizing Duplication

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Promoted content has been deprecated in favor of YAML anchors. For more information, see <a href=#deprecated>Deprecated App Manifest Features</a>.</p>

In manifests where multiple applications share settings or services, you may see duplicated content. While the manifests still work, duplication increases the risk of typographical errors, which cause deployments to fail.

You can declare shared configuration using a YAML anchor, which the manifest refers to in app declarations by using an alias.

<pre>
---
defaults: &amp;defaults
  buildpacks: 
    - staticfile_buildpack
  memory: 1G


applications:
- name: bigapp
  &lt;&lt;: *defaults
- name: smallapp
  &lt;&lt;: *defaults
  memory: 256M
</pre>

This manifest pushes two apps, smallapp and bigapp, with the staticfile buildpack but with 256M memory for smallapp and 1G for bigapp.


## <a id='variable-substitution'></a> Variable Substitution

Variable substitution replaces [Inheritance](#inheritance-deprecated), which has been deprecated.  

Value substitution allow app developers to create app manifests with values shared across all applicable environments in combination with references to environment-specific differences defined in separate files. It addition, using variable substitution enables developers to store sensitive data in a separate file that the app manifest would reference, making the security sensitive data easier to manage and keep secure.

To utilize this feature, your app manifest requires an explicit declaration that the app or app configuration requires additional data. Use template variables in parentheses in your app manifest in place of fixed values.

For example:

<pre>
---
applications:
- name: test-app
  instances: ((instances))
  memory: ((memory))
  buildpack: go_buildpack
  env:
    GOPACKAGENAME: go_calls_ruby
  command: go_calls_ruby
</pre>

The variable substitution file should have corresponding attribute values:
<pre>
instances: 2
memory: 1G
</pre>

The CLI replaces the variables in the app manifest with the specified values and proceeds with the push process as usual.

For example: 

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push foo-app -f ~/workspace/var_manifest.yml --vars-file ~/workspace/vars.yml
Pushing from manifest to org Doop / space lessing as achau@pivotal.io...
Using manifest file /Users/achau/workspace/var_manifest.yml
Getting app info...
Creating app with these attributes...
+ name:        foo-app
  path:        /Users/achau/workspace/cf-acceptance-tests/assets/dora
+ instances:   2
+ memory:      1G
  routes:
+   foo-app.cfapps.io
...
</pre>

Template variables can also be used as partial values. Starting with the following manifest.yml:

<pre class="terminal">
---
applications:
  - name: ((app-name))
    instances: ((instances))
    env:
      ((env-key)): ((env-val))
    routes:
      - route: ((host)).env.com
</pre>

and a secrets.yml variable file:

<pre class="terminal">
---
app-name: test-app
instances: 2
env-key: HIDDEN
env-val: HIDDEN
host: test
</pre>

When you do a push invoking both files above, the partial value for `routes` in the manifest.yml is replaced by `host` in the variables.yml file.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push -f manifest.yml --vars-file secrets.yml
Pushing from manifest to org system / space maspace as admin...
Using manifest file manifest.yml
Getting app info...
Creating app with these attributes...
+ name:        test-app
  path:        /home/pivotal/go/src/github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-acceptance-tests/assets/dora
+ instances:   2
  env:
+   HIDDEN
  routes:
+   test.env.com
Creating app test-app...
</pre>



## <a id='deprecated'></a> Deprecated App Manifest Features

These app manifest features have been deprecated in favor of existing options.

### <a id='yaml-anchors'></a> YAML Anchors Replace Promoted Content

Previously, you could manage duplicated settings in YAML files by “promoting” the duplicate content — that is, by moving it to above the applications block, where it need appear only once.

The following example illustrates how promoted content was used to manage duplicated settings.

<pre>
---
# all applications use these settings and services
domain: shared-domain.example.com
memory: 1G
instances: 1
services:
- clockwork-mysql
applications:
- name: springtock
  host: tock09876
  path: ./spring-music/build/libs/spring-music.war
- name: springtick
  host: tick09875
  path: ./spring-music/build/libs/spring-music.war
</pre>

Now, you can use YAML aliases instead.
            
The following example illustrates how to declare shared configuration using a YAML anchor, which the manifest refers to in app declarations by using an alias.

<pre>
---
defaults: &amp;defaults
  buildpacks: 
    - staticfile_buildpack
  memory: 1G


applications:
- name: bigapp
  &lt;&lt;: *defaults
- name: smallapp
  &lt;&lt;: *defaults
  memory: 256M
</pre>

When pushing the app, make explicit the attributes in each app’s declaration. To do this, assign the anchors and include the app-level attributes with YAML aliases in each app declaration.

### <a id='route-attribute'></a> Attribute routes Replaces domain, domains, host, hosts, and no-hostname

Previously, you could specify routes by listing them all at once using the `routes` attribute, or by using their hosts and domains as shown below.

<pre>
---
applications
- name: webapp
  host: www
  domains:
  - example.com
  - example.io
</pre>

The following route component attributes have been deprecated:
<ul>
  <li><code>domain</code></li>
  <li><code>domains</code></li>
  <li><code>host</code></li>
  <li><code>hosts</code></li>
  <li><code>no-hostname</code></li>
</ul>

Now you can only specify routes by using the `routes` attribute:

<pre>
---
applications
- name: webapp
  routes:
  - route: www.example.com/foo 
  - route: tcp.example.com:1234
</pre>

This app manifest feature has been deprecated, and a replacement option is under consideration.

### <a id='inheritance-deprecated'></a> Inheritance

This feature has been deprecated, and has been replaced by [Variable Substitution](#variable-substitution).

With inheritance, child manifests inherited configurations from a parent manifest, and the child manifests could use inherited configurations as provided, extend them, or override them. This feature has been deprecated, and has been replaced by [Variable Substitution](#multi-manifests).
