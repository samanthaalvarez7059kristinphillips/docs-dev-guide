_This page assumes that you are using cf v5._

This page has information specific to deploying Rack, Rails, or Sinatra applications.

## <a id='bundler'></a> Application Bundling ##

You need to run <a href="http://gembundler.com/">Bundler</a> to create a `Gemfile` and a `Gemfile.lock`. These files must be in your application before you push to Cloud Foundry.

## <a id='config'></a> Rack Config File ##

For Rack and Sinatra you need a `config.ru` file like this:

~~~ruby
require './hello_world'
run HelloWorld.new
~~~

## <a id='precompile'></a> Asset Precompilation ##

Cloud Foundry supports the Rails asset pipeline. If you do not precompile assets before deploying your application, Cloud Foundry will precompile them when staging the application. Precompiling before deploying reduces the time it takes to stage an application.

Use this command to precompile assets before deployment:

<pre class="terminal">
rake assets:precompile
</pre>


Note that the Rake precompile task reinitializes the Rails application. This could pose a problem if initialization requires service connections or environment checks that are unavailable during staging. To prevent reinitialization during precompilation, add this line to `application.rb`:

~~~ruby
config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false
~~~

If the `assets:precompile` task fails, Cloud Foundry uses live compilation mode, the alternative to asset precompilation. In this mode, assets are compiled when they are loaded for the first time. You can force live compilation by adding this line to `application.rb`.

~~~ruby
Rails.application.config.assets.compile = true
~~~


## <a id='rake'></a> Running Rake Tasks ##

Cloud Foundry does not provide a mechanism for running a Rake task on a deployed application.
If you need to run a Rake task that must be performed in the Cloud Foundry environment (rather than locally before deploying or redeploying), you can configure the command that Cloud Foundry uses to start the application to invoke the Rake task.

An application's start command is configured in the application's manifest file, `manifest.yml`, with the `command` attribute.

If you have previously deployed the application, the application manifest should already exist. There are two ways to create a manifest. You can manually create the file and save it in the application's root directory before you deploy the application for the first time. If you do not manually create the manifest file, cf will prompt you to supply deployment settings when you first push the application, and will create and save the manifest file for you, with the settings you specified interactively. For more information about application manifests, and supported attributes, see [Application Manifests](manifest.html).

For an example of invoking a Rake database migration task at application startup, see [Migrate a Database for a Rails App](../services/migrate-db.html#migrate-ruby-db).


## <a id='workers'></a> Running Rails 3 Worker Tasks ##

Often when developing a Rails 3 application, you may want delay certain tasks so as not to consume resource that could be used for servicing requests from your user. This section shows you how to create and deploy an example Rails application that will make use of a worker library to defer a task, this task will then be executed by a separate application. The guide also shows how you can scale the resource available to the worker application.

### <a id='worker-libs'></a> Choosing a Worker Task Library ###

The first task is to decide which worker task library to use. Here is a summary of the three main libraries available for Ruby / Rails:


| Library          | Description |
| :------------------ | :------- |
|[Delayed::Job](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job) |A direct extraction from [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/) where the job table is responsible for a multitude of core tasks. |
|[Resque](https://github.com/defunkt/resque) |A Redis-backed library for creating background jobs, placing those jobs on multiple queues, and processing them later. |
|[Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq)|Uses threads to handle many messages at the same time in the same process. It does not require Rails but will integrate tightly with Rails 3 to make background message processing dead simple." This library is also Redis-backed and is actually somewhat compatible with Resque messaging. |

For other alternatives, see [https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/Background_Jobs](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/Background_Jobs)

### <a id='example-app'></a> Creating an Example Application ###

For the purposes of the example application, we will use Sidekiq.

First, create a Rails application with an arbitrary model called "Things":

<pre class="terminal">
$ rails create rails-sidekiq
$ cd rails-sidekiq
$ rails g model Thing title:string description:string
</pre>

Add `sidekiq` and `uuidtools` to the Gemfile:

~~~ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'rails', '3.2.9'
gem 'mysql2'

group :assets do
  gem 'sass-rails',   '~> 3.2.3'
  gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 3.2.1'
  gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.0.3'
end

gem 'jquery-rails'
gem 'sidekiq'
gem 'uuidtools'
~~~

Install the bundle.

<pre class="terminal">
$ bundle install
</pre>

Create a worker (in app/workers) for Sidekiq to carry out its tasks:

<pre class="terminal">
$ touch app/workers/thing_worker.rb
</pre>

~~~ruby
class ThingWorker

  include Sidekiq::Worker

  def perform(count)

    count.times do

      thing_uuid = UUIDTools::UUID.random_create.to_s
      Thing.create :title => "New Thing (#{thing_uuid})", :description => "Description for thing #{thing_uuid}"
    end

  end

end
~~~

This worker will create n number of things, where n is the value passed to the worker.

Create a controller for "Things":

<pre class="terminal">
$ rails g controller Thing
</pre>

~~~ruby
class ThingController < ApplicationController

  def new
    ThingWorker.perform_async(2)
    redirect_to '/thing'
  end

  def index
    @things = Thing.all
  end

end
~~~

Add a view to inspect our collection of "Things":

<pre class="terminal">
$ mkdir app/views/things
$ touch app/views/things/index.html.erb
</pre>

~~~html
<%= @things.inspect %>
~~~

#### <a id='deploy'></a>Deploying Once, Deploying Twice ####

This application needs to be deployed twice for it to work, once as a Rails web application and once as a standalone Ruby application. The easiest way to do this is to keep separate CF manifests for each application type:

Web Manifest: Save this as `web-manifest.yml`:

~~~yaml
---
applications:
- name: sidekiq
  memory: 256M
  instances: 1
  host: sidekiq
  domain: ${target-base}
  path: .
  services:
    sidekiq-mysql:
      vendor: mysql
      version: "5.1"
      tier: free
    sidekiq-redis:
      vendor: redis
      version: "2.6"
      tier: free
~~~

Worker Manifest: Save this as `worker-manifest.yml`:

~~~yaml
---
applications:
- name: sidekiq-worker
  memory: 256M
  instances: 1
  path: .
  command: bundle exec sidekiq
  services:
    sidekiq-redis:
      vendor: redis
      version: "2.6"
      tier: free
    sidekiq-mysql:
      vendor: mysql
      version: "5.1"
      tier: free
~~~

Since the url "sidekiq.cloudfoundry.com" is probably already taken, change it in `web-manifest.yml` first, then push the application with both manifest files:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push -m web-manifest.yml
$ cf push -m worker-manifest.yml
</pre>

If `CF` asks for a URL for the worker application, select "none".

### <a id='test'></a>Test the Application ###

Test the application by visiting the new action on the "Thing" controller at the assigned url. In this example, the URL would be `http://sidekiq.cloudfoundry.com/thing/new`.

This will create a new Sidekiq job which will be queued in Redis, then picked up by the worker application. The browser is then redirected to `/thing` which will show the collection of "Things".

### <a id='test'></a>Scale Workers ###

Use the `cf scale` command to change the number of Sidekiq workers. 

Example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf scale sidekiq-worker --instances 2
</pre>
