title: Using the cf CLI with an HTTP Proxy Server
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

If you have an HTTP proxy server on your network between a host running the cf CLI and your Cloud Foundry API endpoint, you must set `https_proxy` with the hostname or IP address of the proxy server.

The `https_proxy` environment variable holds the hostname or IP address of your
proxy server.

`https_proxy` is a standard environment variable.
Like any environment variable, the specific steps you use to set it depends on
your operating system.

## <a id="format"></a>Format of https_proxy ##

`https_proxy` is set with hostname or IP address of the proxy server in URL
format: `https_proxy=http://proxy.example.com`

If the proxy server requires a user name and password, include the credentials:
`https_proxy=http://username:password@proxy.example.com`

If the proxy server uses a port other than 80, include the port number:
`https_proxy=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080`


## <a id="mac-linux"></a>Setting https_proxy in Mac OS or Linux ##

Set the `https_proxy` environment variable using the command specific to your
shell.
For example, in bash, use the `export` command.

Example:
<pre class=terminal>
$ export https_proxy=http:/<span>/</span>my.proxyserver.com:8080
</pre>

To make this change persistent, add the command to the appropriate profile file
for the shell.
For example, in bash, add a line like the following to your `.bash_profile` or
`.bashrc` file:

<pre class="detect-script"t>
  https_proxy=http://username:password@hostname:port
  export $https_proxy
</pre>
